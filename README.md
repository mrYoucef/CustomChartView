# CustomChartView
The reason I created this widget is that Qt's built-in charting modules are part of the paid Qt Commercial edition. Since I wanted to create a fully functional charting system without the costs, I decided to implement my own module using Qt5. This gives you a powerful, open-source solution that integrates seamlessly with Qt!
